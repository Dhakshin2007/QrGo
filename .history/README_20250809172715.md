## 💓 Overview
QrGo is a global event booking platform designed for both organizers and participants. 
It enables users to register for events, get unique QR codes, and allows organizers to manage event attendees efficiently. 
The platform supports global access, meaning bookings can be made from anywhere in the world.

## 😎 Key Features
- **User Registration & Booking**: Participants can book tickets for any available event.
- **Secure QR Codes**: Each booking generates a QR code containing event and user details.
- **My Tickets Page**: Users can log in with their email and secret PIN to view their tickets and QR codes.
- **Scanning & Entry Management**: Organizers and authorized workers can scan tickets to mark attendance.
- **Role-Based Access**: Admins can manage events, bookings, and workers for scanning operations.
- **Global Access**: Fully online backend ensures that bookings and data are available worldwide.

## 🌚 API Overview

This project uses **Supabase** as the backend to provide secure and scalable RESTful API endpoints that allow you to:

- Create, update, and manage events.
- Handle bookings while ensuring transaction IDs are unique to prevent duplicates.
- Retrieve user bookings using email and PIN authentication.
- Update booking status in real-time after scanning.
- Manage worker accounts with controlled access permissions.

All data interactions leverage Supabase’s powerful Postgres database and built-in authentication for seamless security and performance.
